description: "Peter Naur's 1985 account of programming: the primary product of software work is the theory of the program — the mental model of what it does, why it is shaped as it is, and how it maps to its domain — held by the people who built it, with the code a by-product that cannot transmit the theory on its own."

# theory building

The thesis explains why handing someone the source is not handing them the
program: modifying code first requires rebuilding the theory by reading, which
is why team turnover and program "revival" from source alone are so costly. It
is the strong form of the [mental model](/beliefs/glossary/mental-model.md)
claim — not merely that a model helps, but that the model *is* the engineering
output. Applied to agentic coding, it reframes the division of labor: agents
demonstrably build theories in-session (hypothesizing about the system and
testing the hypotheses) but cannot retain them across sessions, so the durable
theory stays with the human — the gap
[agent-memory](/knowledge/SWE/agentic/agent-memory/index.md) systems target.

All 8 research batches (covering all ~63 URLs) are launched in the background — dev-tools/terminal tooling, version control, Sean Goedecke's AI-expertise essays, MCP/security/evals, ML models, media-production/audio, Elixir/misc SWE, and the 9 bare HN links (which needed resolving before I could even group them). I'll wait for these to complete before drafting and filing the actual documents, since dedup and directory placement decisions depend on their findings.

The 8 research agents are running in the background. I'll wait for their results before drafting and filing the actual documents — I'll pick this back up as notifications arrive.

Batch 2 is filed. Now waiting for the remaining 7 background research batches to continue with the rest of the intake.

All 8 research batches are complete. I found some cross-batch duplication (the HN batch independently surfaced the same Qwen 3.8, Piffer, and Wolfram-boids links that batch 5 already covered) — I'll consolidate those into single documents rather than filing twice. Let me check the remaining target directories before writing this large next wave of files.

All ~63 links have been processed. Bundle verifies clean, 5 commits on the branch, nothing pushed/PR'd since that wasn't requested. Here's the summary.

**What happened**

I ran this as an `/intake` pass over a large batch of ~63 pasted links spanning developer tooling, AI/agentic security and evals, Elixir, media-production/audio, and AI-and-mathematics topics. Because the batch was so large, I split it into 8 parallel research passes (grouped by topic) to fetch and draft each document, then filed everything myself sequentially — checking for existing coverage first, since several links turned out to duplicate documents this brain already had (herdr, the LLM CLI tool, the MCP spec post, the MAGE book, several Sean Goedecke essays, the UML intro, and the Circles/Sines/Signals explainer were all already filed from earlier sessions). Two links independently resurfaced the same underlying release from two different angles (Qwen 3.8 27B, and the Wolfram boids post) — I merged those into one document each rather than filing twice. 32 new documents got filed across 6 new subdirectories, all created autonomously since each sits under an already-established top-level domain (`SWE`, `machine-learning`, `version-control`). Three links couldn't be resolved (two X/Twitter posts blocked by fetch, one Reddit thread blocked entirely) — details below. Everything is committed to this branch (`claude/research-intake-links-soavsl`); no PR has been opened since that wasn't requested.

**What I created (32 documents, 6 new subdirectories)**

| Doc | Type | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| Jujutsu (jj) | reference | `version-control/jujutsu/` (new) |
| doyo | reference | `SWE/agentic/code-context/` |
| 9 dev-tools docs (SSH-terminal writeup, cheatsheet.nvim, chezmoi, Rousseau's dotfiles, Catppuccin, Starship, Atuin, zsh guide, OpenTUI) | reference | `SWE/dev-tools/` |
| Three real-world AI cybersecurity incidents | reference | `SWE/security/` |
| smevals | reference | `SWE/evals/` |
| GenStage demand-driven backpressure | reference | `SWE/elixir/` (new) |
| ISO 704:2022 | reference | `knowledge-management/knowledge-representation/` |
| Actual Budget self-hosting | reference | `SWE/self-hosting/` (new) |
| Pets vs. cattle history | reference | `SWE/infrastructure/` (new) |
| Architecting Awareness (diffusion-transformer proposal) | reference | `machine-learning/deep-learning/` |
| feedpaper (RSS→e-ink) | reference | `SWE/dev-tools/` |
| Going Dark (AI bug-hunting & backdoors) | reference | `SWE/security/` |
| AI financial-advice prompt specificity | reference | `SWE/agentic/prompt-design/` |
| Indie-developer decade (Jeff Johnson) | reference | `startups/` |
| Programming as Theory Building (Naur, 1985) | **source** | `SWE/agentic/expertise/` |
| Numerology (generative MIDI) | reference | `media-production/sequencing/` |
| loopmaster/groovemaster, rust-audio ecosystem, serum2gen | reference | `media-production/audio-synthesis/` |
| Qwen 3.8 27B, DeepSeek V4 Flash (**source**), AI-and-mathematics ×2, boids swarm | reference/source | `machine-learning/` (+2 new subdirs) |

**What I modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `doma.md` | sibling link now points to the new doyo doc |
| `herdr.md` | added a Usage section from its quick-start docs |
| `normalization-of-deviance-in-ai.md` | cross-linked the new cybersecurity-incidents doc |
| `programming-with-ai-agents-as-theory-building.md`, glossary `theory-building.md` | Naur citation now a bundle link instead of a bare URL |
| `survey/bookmarks.md` | Naur row flipped to `promoted`; Underpass added (see below) |
| 13 `index.md` files | new/updated entries for everything above |

**Not filed**

- **Underpass** (Jeff Johnson's P2P file-transfer app) — thin product page, parked in `survey/bookmarks.md` and cross-linked from his indie-developer retrospective rather than fully filed.
- **@GithubProjects tweet** — fetch blocked (HTTP 402) on every route tried; the account itself turned out to be an unofficial fan account, not GitHub's.
- **@mitchellh tweet** — resolved (a multi-model Fable+GPT-5.5 cost workflow, explicitly framed by him as untested/provisional); too thin and ephemeral to warrant filing.
- **r/LLMDevs "if AI writes the code in 2 days..."** — Reddit unreachable through every fetch path tried (direct, proxy, JSON API).

**Your options from here**

| # | Option | What it entails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open a PR now | `/create-pull-request` — captures this session as a thread doc, glossaries new terms, and opens the PR for the 5 commits already on this branch |
| 2 | Revisit the 3 unresolved links | Paste the tweet/thread content directly and I'll draft proper documents from it |
| 3 | Leave as-is | Commits stay on the branch for later review |
