# Boids without locality — a force-field swarm variant

Craig Reynolds' original 1986 boids model produces flocking from three local
rules — separation, alignment, cohesion — applied only among neighbors
within a fixed radius; locality is a load-bearing assumption of the model.
This Wolfram Community write-up implements a variant that replaces the three
rules with a single continuous force law between every pair of agents:
attraction at longer range, repulsion at short range, with the repulsive
term regularized (treating each agent as a small "cloud" rather than a
point) so the force doesn't blow up as two agents approach zero distance —
the same technique used in vortex-particle fluid simulations, and
structurally the same shape as the Lennard-Jones potential governing atomic
interactions.

## The core update rule

```
x = 0.995x + 0.02*f[p] - 0.01*f[q]
```

1,000 particles, each randomly assigned one "friend" (p) and one "enemy"
(q), contract slightly toward center each timestep, move a larger step
toward their friend, and a smaller step away from their enemy, with periodic
random reassignment of friend/enemy pairs; forces attenuate with proximity
to prevent runaway clustering.

## The notable result

This model still produces coherent swarm/flocking behavior — clumping,
coordinated movement — **without any neighbor-radius or locality assumption
at all**: every agent interacts with every other agent, all the time, and
organized structure still emerges from the force balance alone. Separate
clumps of agents stay independently cohesive once formed, but a nearby
clump's field can perturb a smaller group enough to trigger re-merging into
a larger swarm — an attractor-basin-like dynamic rather than a purely local
rule-following one.

Community members built on it with 3D variants, alternate parameters
producing ring formations, larger-scale renders, velocity-based coloring,
and spherical projections.

## Relation to this bundle's material

This is an adjacent but distinct family from the population/distribution-based
search methods this bundle already tracks under
[evolutionary-computation](/knowledge/machine-learning/evolutionary-computation/index.md):
emergent coordination from pairwise local (or, here, global) rules — no
fitness function, no selection, no generational structure — closer to
multi-agent systems and complex-systems modeling than to optimization.

2 tagged region(s), lifted whole. Refs shown are the full ref-set of each region (this matter plus any it co-feeds).

**[`em:e307c9`]**  (co-feeds: `em:3a1493 em:7b6928 em:9673c2 em:464bf7 em:144256 em:9a3434 em:edcaa2 em:0ecaed em:f13f81 em:a082f1 em:8f8a6b em:c06647 em:d138ff em:738593 em:eb9f29 em:b2676a em:333fce em:871b41 em:0512fe em:1d214a em:2357ce em:732198 em:ef34f0 em:87b2dd em:2afa02 em:3da9e6 em:69cd30 em:414eec em:6d4051 em:f988c6 em:bc60f3 em:7cdaf6 em:a77fb7 em:e4e835 em:25aa97 em:805f4d survey/bookmarks.md`)

All 8 research batches (covering all ~63 URLs) are launched in the background — dev-tools/terminal tooling, version control, Sean Goedecke's AI-expertise essays, MCP/security/evals, ML models, media-production/audio, Elixir/misc SWE, and the 9 bare HN links (which needed resolving before I could even group them). I'll wait for these to complete before drafting and filing the actual documents, since dedup and directory placement decisions depend on their findings.

The 8 research agents are running in the background. I'll wait for their results before drafting and filing the actual documents — I'll pick this back up as notifications arrive.

Batch 2 is filed. Now waiting for the remaining 7 background research batches to continue with the rest of the intake.

All 8 research batches are complete. I found some cross-batch duplication (the HN batch independently surfaced the same Qwen 3.8, Piffer, and Wolfram-boids links that batch 5 already covered) — I'll consolidate those into single documents rather than filing twice. Let me check the remaining target directories before writing this large next wave of files.

All ~63 links have been processed. Bundle verifies clean, 5 commits on the branch, nothing pushed/PR'd since that wasn't requested. Here's the summary.

**What happened**

I ran this as an `/intake` pass over a large batch of ~63 pasted links spanning developer tooling, AI/agentic security and evals, Elixir, media-production/audio, and AI-and-mathematics topics. Because the batch was so large, I split it into 8 parallel research passes (grouped by topic) to fetch and draft each document, then filed everything myself sequentially — checking for existing coverage first, since several links turned out to duplicate documents this brain already had (herdr, the LLM CLI tool, the MCP spec post, the MAGE book, several Sean Goedecke essays, the UML intro, and the Circles/Sines/Signals explainer were all already filed from earlier sessions). Two links independently resurfaced the same underlying release from two different angles (Qwen 3.8 27B, and the Wolfram boids post) — I merged those into one document each rather than filing twice. 32 new documents got filed across 6 new subdirectories, all created autonomously since each sits under an already-established top-level domain (`SWE`, `machine-learning`, `version-control`). Three links couldn't be resolved (two X/Twitter posts blocked by fetch, one Reddit thread blocked entirely) — details below. Everything is committed to this branch (`claude/research-intake-links-soavsl`); no PR has been opened since that wasn't requested.

**What I created (32 documents, 6 new subdirectories)**

**What I modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `doma.md` | sibling link now points to the new doyo doc |
| `herdr.md` | added a Usage section from its quick-start docs |
| `normalization-of-deviance-in-ai.md` | cross-linked the new cybersecurity-incidents doc |
| `programming-with-ai-agents-as-theory-building.md`, glossary `theory-building.md` | Naur citation now a bundle link instead of a bare URL |
| `survey/bookmarks.md` | Naur row flipped to `promoted`; Underpass added (see below) |
| 13 `index.md` files | new/updated entries for everything above |

**Not filed**

- **Underpass** (Jeff Johnson's P2P file-transfer app) — thin product page, parked in `survey/bookmarks.md` and cross-linked from his indie-developer retrospective rather than fully filed.
- **@GithubProjects tweet** — fetch blocked (HTTP 402) on every route tried; the account itself turned out to be an unofficial fan account, not GitHub's.
- **@mitchellh tweet** — resolved (a multi-model Fable+GPT-5.5 cost workflow, explicitly framed by him as untested/provisional); too thin and ephemeral to warrant filing.
- **r/LLMDevs "if AI writes the code in 2 days..."** — Reddit unreachable through every fetch path tried (direct, proxy, JSON API).

**Your options from here**

| # | Option | What it entails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open a PR now | `/create-pull-request` — captures this session as a thread doc, glossaries new terms, and opens the PR for the 5 commits already on this branch |
| 2 | Revisit the 3 unresolved links | Paste the tweet/thread content directly and I'll draft proper documents from it |
| 3 | Leave as-is | Commits stay on the branch for later review |

**[`em:e307c9`]**  (co-feeds: `em:3a1493 em:7b6928 em:9673c2 em:464bf7 em:144256 em:9a3434 em:edcaa2 em:0ecaed em:f13f81 em:a082f1 em:8f8a6b em:c06647 em:d138ff em:738593 em:eb9f29 em:333fce em:871b41 em:0512fe em:1d214a em:2357ce em:732198 em:ef34f0 em:87b2dd em:2afa02 em:3da9e6 em:6d4051 em:f988c6 em:bc60f3 em:7cdaf6 em:a77fb7 em:e4e835 em:25aa97 em:805f4d`)

Good catch — the gap is real and accounted for, not a dropped batch. Here's the reconciliation:

| Category | Links | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Filed as new documents** | 42 | Several links merged into one doc each (see below) |
| **Already covered by earlier intake sessions** | 16 | Confirmed by dedup search — same `resource` URL or same essay already filed; a few got a cross-link update, no new doc |
| **Unresolved / not filed** | 4 | Reddit thread (blocked), @GithubProjects tweet (blocked, turned out unofficial anyway), @mitchellh tweet (thin/ephemeral, reviewed not filed), Underpass (thin product page, parked in bookmarks instead) |
| **Update-in-place, not a new doc** | 1 | herdr's quick-start page added a Usage section to the *existing* herdr.md |
| **Total** | **63** | |

The 42→32 gap is 9 cases where multiple links were the same underlying thing, filed once:

| Merged into | From links |
|---|---|
| Qwen 3.8 27B | direct Willison link + HN link to the same post + HN link to the HF model card (3 links) |
| GenStage backpressure | the blog post + the Reddit thread discussing it |
| Sebastien Rousseau's dotfiles | the repo + its companion design post |
| smevals | the blog post + the project's own README |
| Catppuccin | the nvim port + the tmux port (one theming project, two ports) |
| rust.audio ecosystem | rust.audio + awesome-audio-dsp (the former just points at the latter) |
| Atuin | atuin.sh + the atuinsh/atuin GitHub repo (same tool) |
| Boids swarm post | the direct Wolfram link + an HN link to the same post |
| Piffer's AI-and-math essay | the direct link + an HN link to the same essay |

So: 42 links → 32 docs (9 merges saving 10), 16 links were dedup no-ops, 4 were dead ends, 1 was an edit rather than a new file. 42 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 63.

Pushed. The branch `claude/research-intake-links-soavsl` is now up to date on the remote with all 5 commits — no PR opened yet, since that wasn't requested. Let me know if you'd like me to open one (`/create-pull-request`).
