# Programming (with AI agents) as theory building

Sean Goedecke reads Peter Naur's 1985 paper *Programming as Theory Building*
against agentic coding. Naur's thesis, as the essay states it: "the core
output of software engineers is not the program itself, but the theory of how
the program works" — "the knowledge inside the engineer's mind is the primary
artifact of engineering work, and the actual software is merely a by-product
of that." The practical form of the claim: "you cannot make a change to a
program simply by having the code" — you first have to read it carefully
enough to build a mental model.

## Does agentic coding erode the theory?

Delegating to agents plausibly thins the engineer's mental model, and the
[skill-formation literature](/knowledge/SWE/agentic/expertise/how-does-ai-impact-skill-formation.md)
supports some version of that. Goedecke's counter is that every theory is
already partial — "every mental model glosses over some fine details" — so the
question is where the glossing happens, not whether.

His own workflow keeps the theory-building with the human: he runs several
agents, reviews their output against his mental model of the system, and
accepts a fraction — "only 10% of agent output is actually making its way into
_my_ output." Reviewing against a theory exercises the theory; the risk
appears when acceptance outruns comprehension, which is where
[capability growth relocates agentic risk into the operator's own mental model](/beliefs/capability-growth-relocates-risk-to-operator-epistemics.md).

## Agents build theories but cannot keep them

Agent logs show genuine theory-building behavior — making hypotheses about how
the system works and trying to confirm or disprove them. The binding
limitation is retention: "they can't _retain_ theories of the codebase. They
have to build their theory from scratch every time. Given that, it's kind of a
minor miracle that AI agents are as effective as they are." A human engineer
amortizes theory across years; an agent re-derives it per session. That
retention gap is precisely the target of
[agent-memory systems](/knowledge/SWE/agentic/agent-memory/index.md).

## Thread excerpts — route-tagged log

Append-only, per-thread, date-stamped excerpts, generated from the `<routes ref="em:69cd30">` regions of the threads that fed this matter and re-derivable via `mix brain.route_tags` — never hand-edit.

### 2026-08-04-goedecke-expertise-essays-intake (2026-08-04)

2 tagged region(s), lifted whole. Refs shown are the full ref-set of each region (this matter plus any it co-feeds).

All quotes are now verified with exact spans. Now for the filing decision — articles 1, 2, 3, and 5 form a coherent cluster on how AI-assisted development interacts with the human engineer's expertise (its leverage, formation, retention, and distribution); no existing `agentic/` subdirectory covers that, so I'll create `knowledge/SWE/agentic/expertise/` (a subdirectory under an established domain — autonomous per the taxonomy protocol). Article 4 is a pure software-design essay and files into the existing `software-design/`. Let me check the id-minting task, then write.

**[`em:69cd30`]**  (co-feeds: `em:3d9101 em:457a88 em:abdca2 em:ccee99`)

Your five links were all new to the brain — none were already filed or parked in the survey tier. Four of them turned out to be one coherent subject: how AI-assisted development interacts with the human engineer's expertise — where it stays the leverage point, how it forms, whether agents can hold it, and what happens to the ability distribution. No existing directory covered that, so I created a new subdirectory for it under the established agentic domain, [`knowledge/SWE/agentic/expertise/`](https://github.com/ob6to8/elixir-mind/blob/claude/ai-software-engineering-expertise-tat4rl/knowledge/SWE/agentic/expertise/index.md) — a within-domain subdirectory, so created autonomously per the taxonomy protocol rather than held for ratification. The fifth essay is a pure software-design piece and filed into the existing `software-design/` directory. Every quote in the filed docs was verified verbatim against the source in a second fetch pass before being quoted; the commit passed the full gate suite and is pushed to the session branch. No PR was opened — that stays with `/create-pull-request`.

1 tagged region(s), lifted whole. Refs shown are the full ref-set of each region (this matter plus any it co-feeds).

All 8 research batches (covering all ~63 URLs) are launched in the background — dev-tools/terminal tooling, version control, Sean Goedecke's AI-expertise essays, MCP/security/evals, ML models, media-production/audio, Elixir/misc SWE, and the 9 bare HN links (which needed resolving before I could even group them). I'll wait for these to complete before drafting and filing the actual documents, since dedup and directory placement decisions depend on their findings.

The 8 research agents are running in the background. I'll wait for their results before drafting and filing the actual documents — I'll pick this back up as notifications arrive.

Batch 2 is filed. Now waiting for the remaining 7 background research batches to continue with the rest of the intake.

All 8 research batches are complete. I found some cross-batch duplication (the HN batch independently surfaced the same Qwen 3.8, Piffer, and Wolfram-boids links that batch 5 already covered) — I'll consolidate those into single documents rather than filing twice. Let me check the remaining target directories before writing this large next wave of files.

All ~63 links have been processed. Bundle verifies clean, 5 commits on the branch, nothing pushed/PR'd since that wasn't requested. Here's the summary.

**What happened**

I ran this as an `/intake` pass over a large batch of ~63 pasted links spanning developer tooling, AI/agentic security and evals, Elixir, media-production/audio, and AI-and-mathematics topics. Because the batch was so large, I split it into 8 parallel research passes (grouped by topic) to fetch and draft each document, then filed everything myself sequentially — checking for existing coverage first, since several links turned out to duplicate documents this brain already had (herdr, the LLM CLI tool, the MCP spec post, the MAGE book, several Sean Goedecke essays, the UML intro, and the Circles/Sines/Signals explainer were all already filed from earlier sessions). Two links independently resurfaced the same underlying release from two different angles (Qwen 3.8 27B, and the Wolfram boids post) — I merged those into one document each rather than filing twice. 32 new documents got filed across 6 new subdirectories, all created autonomously since each sits under an already-established top-level domain (`SWE`, `machine-learning`, `version-control`). Three links couldn't be resolved (two X/Twitter posts blocked by fetch, one Reddit thread blocked entirely) — details below. Everything is committed to this branch (`claude/research-intake-links-soavsl`); no PR has been opened since that wasn't requested.

**What I modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `doma.md` | sibling link now points to the new doyo doc |
| `herdr.md` | added a Usage section from its quick-start docs |
| `normalization-of-deviance-in-ai.md` | cross-linked the new cybersecurity-incidents doc |
| `programming-with-ai-agents-as-theory-building.md`, glossary `theory-building.md` | Naur citation now a bundle link instead of a bare URL |
| `survey/bookmarks.md` | Naur row flipped to `promoted`; Underpass added (see below) |
| 13 `index.md` files | new/updated entries for everything above |

**Not filed**

- **Underpass** (Jeff Johnson's P2P file-transfer app) — thin product page, parked in `survey/bookmarks.md` and cross-linked from his indie-developer retrospective rather than fully filed.
- **@GithubProjects tweet** — fetch blocked (HTTP 402) on every route tried; the account itself turned out to be an unofficial fan account, not GitHub's.
- **@mitchellh tweet** — resolved (a multi-model Fable+GPT-5.5 cost workflow, explicitly framed by him as untested/provisional); too thin and ephemeral to warrant filing.
- **r/LLMDevs "if AI writes the code in 2 days..."** — Reddit unreachable through every fetch path tried (direct, proxy, JSON API).

**Your options from here**

| # | Option | What it entails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open a PR now | `/create-pull-request` — captures this session as a thread doc, glossaries new terms, and opens the PR for the 5 commits already on this branch |
| 2 | Revisit the 3 unresolved links | Paste the tweet/thread content directly and I'll draft proper documents from it |
| 3 | Leave as-is | Commits stay on the branch for later review |
