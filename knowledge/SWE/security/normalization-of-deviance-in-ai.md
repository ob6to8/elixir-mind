title: "The Normalization of Deviance in AI (wunderwuzzi)"
description: Vendors and adopters are repeating the Challenger-disaster pattern of normalizing deviance — treating each successful run of an insecure agentic setup as proof of safety, so oversight erodes exactly as agent capability (and the cost of a miss) rises.

# The Normalization of Deviance in AI

wunderwuzzi applies sociologist Diane Vaughan's concept from the Space Shuttle
*Challenger* investigation to agentic AI deployment. **Normalization of
deviance** is "the process in which deviance from correct or proper behavior
or rule becomes culturally normalized" — each near-miss that doesn't cause
visible harm is read as evidence the risky practice is fine, rather than as a
warning, and the guardrail erodes a little further next time.

## The pattern in AI

Vendors and organizations "lower their guard or skip human oversight
entirely, because 'it worked last time.'" The result is a false sense of
security: "organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the
presence of robust security." Major vendors (Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google) openly acknowledge agentic risks — data exfiltration, prompt
injection, unintended actions — yet keep shipping agentic features faster
than the guardrails around them mature, because competitive pressure to ship
first outweighs the incentive to invest in security first.

## The structural claim

The article's operative security principle: "security controls (access
checks, proper encoding, and sanitization, etc.) must be applied downstream
of LLM output" — the model's output is never itself a trust boundary, however
well-behaved it has appeared so far. Agentic systems that skip this and let
model output act with ambient privilege are exactly the deviance the piece
names: each unchecked run that doesn't misfire normalizes the gap a little
further.

## Recommendation

The article argues AI systems should stay "human-led, particularly in
high-stake contexts," backed by real threat modeling, sandboxing, and
least-privilege access — not by hoping "the model will just do the right
thing." This is the same erosion-of-oversight shape as
[Ambient agent observability](/knowledge/SWE/agentic/supervision/ambient-agent-observability.md)
describes from the supervision side, and the downstream-of-output principle
matches
[Indirect prompt injection in document pipelines](/knowledge/SWE/security/indirect-prompt-injection-in-document-pipelines.md):
both treat model output as attacker-influenced input to the next system, not
as a trusted instruction source.

A concrete, dated case study of this exact failure —an eval's only safeguard
being an instruction telling the model it was sandboxed, rather than an
actual control on what it could reach — is

All 8 research batches (covering all ~63 URLs) are launched in the background — dev-tools/terminal tooling, version control, Sean Goedecke's AI-expertise essays, MCP/security/evals, ML models, media-production/audio, Elixir/misc SWE, and the 9 bare HN links (which needed resolving before I could even group them). I'll wait for these to complete before drafting and filing the actual documents, since dedup and directory placement decisions depend on their findings.

The 8 research agents are running in the background. I'll wait for their results before drafting and filing the actual documents — I'll pick this back up as notifications arrive.

Batch 2 is filed. Now waiting for the remaining 7 background research batches to continue with the rest of the intake.

All 8 research batches are complete. I found some cross-batch duplication (the HN batch independently surfaced the same Qwen 3.8, Piffer, and Wolfram-boids links that batch 5 already covered) — I'll consolidate those into single documents rather than filing twice. Let me check the remaining target directories before writing this large next wave of files.

All ~63 links have been processed. Bundle verifies clean, 5 commits on the branch, nothing pushed/PR'd since that wasn't requested. Here's the summary.

**What happened**

I ran this as an `/intake` pass over a large batch of ~63 pasted links spanning developer tooling, AI/agentic security and evals, Elixir, media-production/audio, and AI-and-mathematics topics. Because the batch was so large, I split it into 8 parallel research passes (grouped by topic) to fetch and draft each document, then filed everything myself sequentially — checking for existing coverage first, since several links turned out to duplicate documents this brain already had (herdr, the LLM CLI tool, the MCP spec post, the MAGE book, several Sean Goedecke essays, the UML intro, and the Circles/Sines/Signals explainer were all already filed from earlier sessions). Two links independently resurfaced the same underlying release from two different angles (Qwen 3.8 27B, and the Wolfram boids post) — I merged those into one document each rather than filing twice. 32 new documents got filed across 6 new subdirectories, all created autonomously since each sits under an already-established top-level domain (`SWE`, `machine-learning`, `version-control`). Three links couldn't be resolved (two X/Twitter posts blocked by fetch, one Reddit thread blocked entirely) — details below. Everything is committed to this branch (`claude/research-intake-links-soavsl`); no PR has been opened since that wasn't requested.

**What I modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `doma.md` | sibling link now points to the new doyo doc |
| `herdr.md` | added a Usage section from its quick-start docs |
| `normalization-of-deviance-in-ai.md` | cross-linked the new cybersecurity-incidents doc |
| `programming-with-ai-agents-as-theory-building.md`, glossary `theory-building.md` | Naur citation now a bundle link instead of a bare URL |
| `survey/bookmarks.md` | Naur row flipped to `promoted`; Underpass added (see below) |
| 13 `index.md` files | new/updated entries for everything above |

**Not filed**

- **Underpass** (Jeff Johnson's P2P file-transfer app) — thin product page, parked in `survey/bookmarks.md` and cross-linked from his indie-developer retrospective rather than fully filed.
- **@GithubProjects tweet** — fetch blocked (HTTP 402) on every route tried; the account itself turned out to be an unofficial fan account, not GitHub's.
- **@mitchellh tweet** — resolved (a multi-model Fable+GPT-5.5 cost workflow, explicitly framed by him as untested/provisional); too thin and ephemeral to warrant filing.
- **r/LLMDevs "if AI writes the code in 2 days..."** — Reddit unreachable through every fetch path tried (direct, proxy, JSON API).

**Your options from here**

| # | Option | What it entails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open a PR now | `/create-pull-request` — captures this session as a thread doc, glossaries new terms, and opens the PR for the 5 commits already on this branch |
| 2 | Revisit the 3 unresolved links | Paste the tweet/thread content directly and I'll draft proper documents from it |
| 3 | Leave as-is | Commits stay on the branch for later review |
