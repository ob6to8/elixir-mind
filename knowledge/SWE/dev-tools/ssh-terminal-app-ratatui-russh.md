# SSH terminal app via ratatui + russh

A HackerNoon write-up describing `ssh agnelnieves.sh` — a personal
website/portfolio rebuilt as an SSH-reachable terminal application, inspired
by [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop) (`ssh terminal.shop`), which sells
coffee through an SSH terminal storefront.

## Architecture

- **[ratatui](https://ratatui.rs)** draws the UI: header, ticker, ASCII
  banner, a projects list, and a blog reader.
- **[russh](https://github.com/Eugeny/russh)** runs the SSH server that hosts
  the session.
- The same render function runs whether the binary is executed locally or
  served over SSH — no divergent code path for the two entry points.
- Content is fetched live from the author's own site API at request time
  (`/feed.json`, `/api/blog/[slug]/raw`, `/api/projects`, `/api/site.json`),
  so the terminal app and the website stay backed by one data source.

## Takeaway

The author frames it as a low-effort experiment — a few evenings poking at
ratatui and russh — that turned out easier than expected, given ratatui
handles the rendering and russh handles the SSH transport, leaving little
glue code once both libraries are in place.

All 8 research batches (covering all ~63 URLs) are launched in the background — dev-tools/terminal tooling, version control, Sean Goedecke's AI-expertise essays, MCP/security/evals, ML models, media-production/audio, Elixir/misc SWE, and the 9 bare HN links (which needed resolving before I could even group them). I'll wait for these to complete before drafting and filing the actual documents, since dedup and directory placement decisions depend on their findings.

The 8 research agents are running in the background. I'll wait for their results before drafting and filing the actual documents — I'll pick this back up as notifications arrive.

Batch 2 is filed. Now waiting for the remaining 7 background research batches to continue with the rest of the intake.

All 8 research batches are complete. I found some cross-batch duplication (the HN batch independently surfaced the same Qwen 3.8, Piffer, and Wolfram-boids links that batch 5 already covered) — I'll consolidate those into single documents rather than filing twice. Let me check the remaining target directories before writing this large next wave of files.

All ~63 links have been processed. Bundle verifies clean, 5 commits on the branch, nothing pushed/PR'd since that wasn't requested. Here's the summary.

**What happened**

I ran this as an `/intake` pass over a large batch of ~63 pasted links spanning developer tooling, AI/agentic security and evals, Elixir, media-production/audio, and AI-and-mathematics topics. Because the batch was so large, I split it into 8 parallel research passes (grouped by topic) to fetch and draft each document, then filed everything myself sequentially — checking for existing coverage first, since several links turned out to duplicate documents this brain already had (herdr, the LLM CLI tool, the MCP spec post, the MAGE book, several Sean Goedecke essays, the UML intro, and the Circles/Sines/Signals explainer were all already filed from earlier sessions). Two links independently resurfaced the same underlying release from two different angles (Qwen 3.8 27B, and the Wolfram boids post) — I merged those into one document each rather than filing twice. 32 new documents got filed across 6 new subdirectories, all created autonomously since each sits under an already-established top-level domain (`SWE`, `machine-learning`, `version-control`). Three links couldn't be resolved (two X/Twitter posts blocked by fetch, one Reddit thread blocked entirely) — details below. Everything is committed to this branch (`claude/research-intake-links-soavsl`); no PR has been opened since that wasn't requested.

**What I created (32 documents, 6 new subdirectories)**

| Doc | Type | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| Jujutsu (jj) | reference | `version-control/jujutsu/` (new) |
| doyo | reference | `SWE/agentic/code-context/` |
| 9 dev-tools docs (SSH-terminal writeup, cheatsheet.nvim, chezmoi, Rousseau's dotfiles, Catppuccin, Starship, Atuin, zsh guide, OpenTUI) | reference | `SWE/dev-tools/` |

| Qwen 3.8 27B, DeepSeek V4 Flash (**source**), AI-and-mathematics ×2, boids swarm | reference/source | `machine-learning/` (+2 new subdirs) |

**What I modified**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `doma.md` | sibling link now points to the new doyo doc |
| `herdr.md` | added a Usage section from its quick-start docs |
| `normalization-of-deviance-in-ai.md` | cross-linked the new cybersecurity-incidents doc |
| `programming-with-ai-agents-as-theory-building.md`, glossary `theory-building.md` | Naur citation now a bundle link instead of a bare URL |
| `survey/bookmarks.md` | Naur row flipped to `promoted`; Underpass added (see below) |
| 13 `index.md` files | new/updated entries for everything above |

**Not filed**

- **Underpass** (Jeff Johnson's P2P file-transfer app) — thin product page, parked in `survey/bookmarks.md` and cross-linked from his indie-developer retrospective rather than fully filed.
- **@GithubProjects tweet** — fetch blocked (HTTP 402) on every route tried; the account itself turned out to be an unofficial fan account, not GitHub's.
- **@mitchellh tweet** — resolved (a multi-model Fable+GPT-5.5 cost workflow, explicitly framed by him as untested/provisional); too thin and ephemeral to warrant filing.
- **r/LLMDevs "if AI writes the code in 2 days..."** — Reddit unreachable through every fetch path tried (direct, proxy, JSON API).

**Your options from here**

| # | Option | What it entails |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open a PR now | `/create-pull-request` — captures this session as a thread doc, glossaries new terms, and opens the PR for the 5 commits already on this branch |
| 2 | Revisit the 3 unresolved links | Paste the tweet/thread content directly and I'll draft proper documents from it |
| 3 | Leave as-is | Commits stay on the branch for later review |

**[`em:0ecaed`]**  (co-feeds: `em:3a1493 em:7b6928 em:9673c2 em:464bf7 em:144256 em:9a3434 em:edcaa2 em:f13f81 em:a082f1 em:8f8a6b em:c06647 em:d138ff em:738593 em:eb9f29 em:333fce em:871b41 em:0512fe em:1d214a em:2357ce em:732198 em:ef34f0 em:87b2dd em:2afa02 em:3da9e6 em:6d4051 em:f988c6 em:bc60f3 em:7cdaf6 em:a77fb7 em:e4e835 em:25aa97 em:e307c9 em:805f4d`)

Good catch — the gap is real and accounted for, not a dropped batch. Here's the reconciliation:

| Category | Links | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Filed as new documents** | 42 | Several links merged into one doc each (see below) |
| **Already covered by earlier intake sessions** | 16 | Confirmed by dedup search — same `resource` URL or same essay already filed; a few got a cross-link update, no new doc |
| **Unresolved / not filed** | 4 | Reddit thread (blocked), @GithubProjects tweet (blocked, turned out unofficial anyway), @mitchellh tweet (thin/ephemeral, reviewed not filed), Underpass (thin product page, parked in bookmarks instead) |
| **Update-in-place, not a new doc** | 1 | herdr's quick-start page added a Usage section to the *existing* herdr.md |
| **Total** | **63** | |

The 42→32 gap is 9 cases where multiple links were the same underlying thing, filed once:

| Merged into | From links |
|---|---|
| Qwen 3.8 27B | direct Willison link + HN link to the same post + HN link to the HF model card (3 links) |
| GenStage backpressure | the blog post + the Reddit thread discussing it |
| Sebastien Rousseau's dotfiles | the repo + its companion design post |
| smevals | the blog post + the project's own README |
| Catppuccin | the nvim port + the tmux port (one theming project, two ports) |
| rust.audio ecosystem | rust.audio + awesome-audio-dsp (the former just points at the latter) |
| Atuin | atuin.sh + the atuinsh/atuin GitHub repo (same tool) |
| Boids swarm post | the direct Wolfram link + an HN link to the same post |
| Piffer's AI-and-math essay | the direct link + an HN link to the same essay |

So: 42 links → 32 docs (9 merges saving 10), 16 links were dedup no-ops, 4 were dead ends, 1 was an edit rather than a new file. 42 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 63.

Pushed. The branch `claude/research-intake-links-soavsl` is now up to date on the remote with all 5 commits — no PR opened yet, since that wasn't requested. Let me know if you'd like me to open one (`/create-pull-request`).
