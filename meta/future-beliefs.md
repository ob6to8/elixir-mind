# Future beliefs

A holding pen for small, true observations about how the brain works that are
worth remembering but not yet formalized into a tutorial, policy, or concept.

- Policies derive their `id` from filename (`SecondBrain.Policy.load!/1` sets
  `id = Path.basename(path, ".md")`), not from a frontmatter field.
- **LLM judgments stay local to edges; structure stays global and mechanical.**
  The design principle for any semiformal epistemic layer: the LLM answers
  small, cacheable, per-edge questions (assertion, entailment, conflict), and
  deterministic graph algorithms compute the global properties (groundedness,
  conflict sets, consensus, blast radius). See the
  [belief-decomposition analysis](/meta/analysis/belief-decomposition-derived-vs-authored.md).
