# Log — meta

Chronological history of the governance namespace. Newest first. ISO 8601 dates.

## 2026-07-05

- Established the `meta/` governance namespace and backfilled the operating contract
  into fourteen `type: policy` documents under `meta/policy/`, grouped into six
  contract sections (composition, directory-structure, filing, type-vocabulary,
  conformance, skills).
- Added the Elixir contract compiler (`mix brain.contract`) that renders `/CLAUDE.md`
  from `meta/preamble.md` + `meta/policy/*.md`, with a trace link under each rule.
  `CLAUDE.md` is now a **generated artifact**.
- Added the `/render-contract` skill and the `policy` type to the vocabulary.
